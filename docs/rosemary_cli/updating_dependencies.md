# Updating dependencies
{: .no_toc }

To update all project dependencies, run:

```
rosemary update
```

{: .warning }
It is the responsibility of the developer to check that the update of the dependencies has not broken any 
functionality and each dependency maintains backwards compatibility. **Use the script with care!**
